# <Prework bootcamp: Learning to Code>

## Description

This project is the beginning stage of my coding career, having no coding experience this prework helped me experience coding in a really basic level. Although it's going to be a long way, hopefully I can look back at this one to see how far I have come. The main task for this project was the creation of a website that shows the studyguide for the prework and I learned about the different stages and topics around creating a new page.
